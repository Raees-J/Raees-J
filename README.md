  <h1>üï∑Ô∏è Hi, I'm Raees Johaadien ‚Äì Your Friendly Neighbourhood Programmer!</h1>
  <h2>Welcome to my Digital Workshop! üëã</h2>

  <p>What started as curiosity about "how websites work" turned into a passion for crafting digital experiences that make people's lives a little bit better. I'm a highly motivated and determined student transitioning into a <strong>Software Developer (Mobile Applications)</strong> role, with a strong focus on <strong>React</strong> development.</p>

  <p>My philosophy? Write clean code, ask thoughtful questions, and never forget that behind every user interface is a human being. I believe that <strong>with great code comes great responsibility!</strong></p>
