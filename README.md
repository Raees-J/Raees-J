<h2>Skills & Interests</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/Raees-J/Raees-J/blob/main/skills%20and%20interests.PNGG">Skills & Interests,</a>
as part of my university career development requirements, I completed an online assessment focused on identifying my key skills, values, and interests. The purpose was to help me understand how these elements relate to my future career path.

My task was to evaluate my current skill set and interests and consider how they align with potential roles in the IT and app development industry.

I took part in an interactive module that assessed various areas including my understanding of values, examples of transferable skills, and how personal interests influence career decisions. I reviewed the feedback carefully to identify areas of strength and those I could improve on.

I achieved a score of 80%, which gave me confidence in my self-awareness and decision-making. The assessment helped me better understand the skills I already possess and how my interests connect to a career in technology. It also provided direction for personal development as I prepare for future opportunities in the field.

<h2>Personality assessment</h2>

as part of my university career development activities, I completed a personality assessment to help me better understand how my traits relate to different career paths and work environments.

The aim was to identify how my personality influences my professional strengths, preferences, and suitability for specific careersâ€”particularly in relation to the IT and app development field.

I took part in an online assessment that explored personality types such as Realistic, Artistic, and Conventional. It included questions about work style, problem-solving approaches, and preferences for certain types of tasks. I carefully reviewed the results to understand how my personality aligns with various career roles.

I achieved a score of 80%, which showed that I have a solid understanding of my personality and how it connects to career planning. The results highlighted my strengths in analytical and creative thinkingâ€”qualities that are essential in tech roles like app development. This exercise gave me clearer insight into the kind of environments where Iâ€™m likely to thrive and helped me make more informed decisions about my career direction.

<h2>CV</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/Raees-J/Raees-J/blob/main/CV.PNG">CV,</a>
as part of my universityâ€™s career counselling portfolio, I was tasked with developing a professional CV. Before this, I only had a basic version that lacked structure and clarity.

I aimed to create a professional CV that accurately represents my academic background, skill set, and work experience, specifically tailored toward a future in app development.

I compiled information from various sources including my academic records, certificates, and part-time employment history. I organized the content into clear sections such as Education, Skills, Achievements, and Work Experience. I also revised my personal statement to highlight qualities like adaptability, motivation, and problem-solving ability.

The final CV is well-structured, professional, and presents my qualifications in a clear and compelling way. Itâ€™s now ready for use in internship and job applications. Completing this task also enhanced my understanding of how to professionally present myself to potential employers.
